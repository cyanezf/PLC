# PLC
A repository for pieces of PLC code
I pretend to add all my functions, structures, "classes" and algorithms that I use in my work.

A brief summary:
How you know, a PLC is a finite machine with little memory to play, but I have managed in some cases to do really strange things, like hash-tables, binary-trees, etc.

I show you a list of pieces of code:

Folders:
1. Abstract data type
2. Motion control functions to control VFC, softstarters, etc.
3. General functions
4. Mathematic functions
5. PID
6. TCP Functions (for Siemens PLC 1200 and 1500)
